## 🚀 How to Contribute: A 5-Step Guide

Here’s a simple workflow to get your contribution merged.

### Step 1: Fork & Clone the Repository
First, create your own copy of this repository by forking it. Then, clone it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ProjectHive.git
cd ProjectHive
```

### Step 2: Create a New Branch
Create a branch with a descriptive name for your contribution.

```bash
git checkout -b add-your-project-name
```

### Step 3: Add Your Project
- Navigate to the appropriate domain: `Domains/[YourDomain]/MiniProjects/`.
- Create a new folder for your project.
- Add all your code files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS, Python).
- **⚠️ COMPULSORY:** Include a `README.md` in your project folder with this line at the start:
  - `**Contributor:** YourGitHubUsername` (replace with your actual GitHub username)
  - **Without this line, you will NOT appear on the leaderboard!**

### Step 4: Commit & Push Your Changes
Commit your changes with a clear message and push them to your forked repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: [Domain] Your Project Name"
git push origin add-your-project-name
```

### Step 5: Create a Pull Request
Go to your forked repository on GitHub and create a Pull Request. Once it's reviewed and merged, you'll automatically appear on the [leaderboard](DomainsLeaderboards/Overall.md)!
