# Online Voting System

The Online Voting System is a web-based platform designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a secure and user-friendly online voting experience.
It allows voters to register, log in, view candidates, and cast their votes electronically, ensuring one vote per user.
The admin can manage elections, candidates, and view live results through interactive dashboards. 
The system offers a clean and responsive interface, real-time result visualization using JavaScript, and easy navigation across pages. 
Built entirely with frontend technologies, it focuses on providing a smooth, transparent, and accessible voting process for users.
