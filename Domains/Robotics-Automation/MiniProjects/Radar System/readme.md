🛰️ Arduino Radar System

The Arduino Radar System uses an ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and LCD display to detect and display the distance of nearby objects at different angles. The servo motor continuously sweeps from 0° to 180°, while the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance and shows both the angle and distance on the LCD screen.

⚙️ Components Used

Arduino UNO (or compatible board)

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

Servo Motor (SG90 or similar)

I2C LCD Display (16x2, address 0x27)

Jumper Wires

Breadboard

🧠 Working Principle

The servo motor rotates from 0° to 180°, scanning the area.

At each step, the ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of any obstacle.

The LCD display shows:

Angle (°) of the servo

Distance (cm) of the detected object

The process repeats continuously to simulate a radar sweep.

💻 Code Overview

The servo moves in a sweep motion (0° → 180° → 0°).

Distance is calculated using ultrasonic sensor readings.

Angle and distance are displayed on the LCD.

🧩 Libraries Required

Make sure you have these libraries installed in Arduino IDE:

Servo.h

Wire.h
